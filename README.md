# COVID-19-ANALYSIS

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data using Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries: NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The project not only explores various aspects of the pandemic, such as trends, statistical summaries, and visual insights, but also integrates the World Happiness Report to offer a broader perspective. Through this analysis, we investigate correlations between happiness factors like GDP, social support, and life expectancy with COVID-19 infection rates across different countries. Multiple graphs and visualizations, including scatter plots and regression analyses, further enhance our understanding of the global impact of the pandemic.
